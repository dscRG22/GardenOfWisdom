    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Our vision is to build communities where wisdom, ethical action, and service guide daily life. By embodying Christ’s teachings collectively, we aim to restore social and spiritual harmony, turning knowledge into practical wisdom that benefits all. The Garden of Wisdom seeks to renew humanity through sustainable, wisdom-centered societies, starting with permaculture villages on Earth and expanding to Mars and beyond. Guided by ethical AI, Socratic education, and a commitment to stewardship, we envision a galactic network of interconnected communities that transcend conflict and foster collective flourishing. Join us in rebuilding Eden, where humanity aligns with divine order, living as the Body of Christ through love, justice, and shared purpose.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content" id="vision">
    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    <h3>The Restoration of the Body of Christ and the Garden of Wisdom</h3>
    <h4>Premise</h4>
    <p>The renewal of Christianity is not merely the return of a religious institution but the awakening of the Body of Christ — humanity living fully in alignment with the archetypes of God, Christ, and Spirit. This restoration rebuilds Eden, not as a mythic past but as a living model for human society, where wisdom, not mere knowledge, sits at the center of our collective life.</p>
    <h4>1. God: The Beyond</h4>
    <p>God represents that which transcends the self: the infinite, the grand design, the unknown. Recognizing God humbles the individual, removing attachment to ego, and inspires curiosity about life beyond personal desire. Through God, humanity awakens to the possibility of alignment with a greater whole — a universe or divine order that calls us to awareness, wisdom, and stewardship.</p>
    <h4>2. Christ: The Human Path</h4>
    <p>Christ embodies humanity in relationship to the Beyond. He demonstrates the path of humility, love, service, and self-emptying. But the ultimate call is not to revere Christ as a savior alone, but to become Christ ourselves: living in harmony with God’s will, the universe, and one another.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Christ is the light and the path to a “city on a hill” — the restored Eden of human society.</li>
      <li>He left tools and teachings we could not fully comprehend at the time; as a unified Body, we now have the capacity to understand and act on them.</li>
      <li>Knowledge alone — dogmas, texts, and doctrines — is insufficient. Wisdom, cultivated through experience, reflection, and collective action, must guide the Body.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Spirit: The Inner Guide</h4>
    <p>The Spirit represents the connection between the individual, the collective, and the divine. Awakening to God and Christ allows the individual to perceive the Spirit — intuition, instinct, conscience, and shared human wisdom.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acting as Christ would, guided by Spirit, is the path to rebuilding Eden and establishing societies centered on wisdom.</li>
      <li>The Spirit equips the Body to discern instinct from selfish desire and align action with collective flourishing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. The Restoration of the Garden</h4>
    <p>Through this triadic process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Humans transcend self-centered living.</li>
      <li>Communities cultivate wisdom, creativity, justice, and stewardship.</li>
      <li>Knowledge, previously confined to dogma, becomes a tool to reach psychological, spiritual, and social maturity.</li>
      <li>Wisdom becomes the central organizing principle, guiding education, governance, and social life.</li>
      <li>Action replaces passive study: weekly ritual is not enough — full engagement with faith, conviction, and service is now required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Communities manifest this vision in practical ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Permaculture-style villages with central learning and gathering spaces, symbolizing the Tree of Wisdom.</li>
      <li>Education rooted in apprenticeship, Socratic dialogue, and communal contribution.</li>
      <li>Cities connected to AI-assisted production hubs, freeing humans to live wisely and creatively.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Call to Action</h4>
    <p>The Body of Christ must awaken as a conscious, living force:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To restore Christ’s image in society by becoming Christ collectively.</li>
      <li>To act with wisdom at the center, not rely on dogmatic knowledge alone.</li>
      <li>To build communities that reflect harmony, stewardship, and Edenic principles.</li>
      <li>To take the tools left by Christ, apply them fully, and manifest the divine order on Earth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is humanity’s greatest opportunity: to transcend conflict, expand consciousness, and engage responsibly with the universe. To be fruitful, multiply in wisdom, and deepen understanding of God through lived experience. The time for passive study and ritual is over. We are called to act fully in faith, wisdom, and conviction — to restore Eden, embody Christ, and live in alignment with the divine design.</p>

    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <h3>The Restoration of the Body of Christ and the Garden of Wisdom</h3>
    <h4>Premise</h4>
    <p>The renewal of Christianity is not merely institutional; it is the awakening of the Body of Christ — humanity collectively embodying the path Christ modeled, guided by Spirit, and aligned with God. This awakening allows us to place wisdom at the center of society, transcend dogma, and rebuild Eden as a living, sustainable reality.</p>
    <h4>1. Foundations of Awakening</h4>
    <h5>God — The Beyond</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognize the infinite, the unknowable, and the order of the universe.</li>
      <li>Humble the self, cultivate awe, and spark curiosity beyond personal desire.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Christ — The Human Path</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Christ models humility, love, and selfless action.</li>
      <li>Humanity must become Christ collectively: living in harmony with divine will, one another, and creation.</li>
      <li>Knowledge alone is insufficient; wisdom guides discernment, action, and communal life.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Spirit — The Inner Guide</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Connects the individual to the collective and the divine.</li>
      <li>Guides reflection on instinct, intuition, and collective unconscious.</li>
      <li>Ensures action aligns with the flourishing of the Body and restoration of Eden.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Principles for the New Garden Society</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Wisdom over Knowledge</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Dogmas, doctrines, and texts are tools to reach this point of collective psychological development.</li>
          <li>Wisdom is action-oriented: discernment, ethical living, and service to the whole.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Collective Embodiment</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The Body must act as one; Christ is no longer an external savior — humanity is now the living manifestation of Christ.</li>
          <li>Communities embody harmony, justice, and stewardship, integrating spiritual, social, and ecological principles.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Action as Faith</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Ritual alone is insufficient; weekly worship is not enough.</li>
          <li>Full engagement — learning, creating, serving — is required to actualize the vision.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Edenic Restoration</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Communities reflect a garden: balanced, life-sustaining, interconnected with the broader ecosystem.</li>
          <li>Human development aligns with ecological and cosmic order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>3. Practical Community Model</h4>
    <h5>A. Central Village Design</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Round central building as the hub of the village.</li>
      <li>Courtyard contains a circular library for conversation, debate, and learning.</li>
      <li>At the highest point, a tree represents the Tree of Wisdom, the symbolic and functional heart of the community.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>B. Education</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Socratic-apprentice model: foundational literacy, numeracy, and reasoning.</li>
      <li>After basics, children choose learning paths and contribute to the community: agriculture, crafts, teaching, stewardship.</li>
      <li>Education integrates mind, body, and ethics — connecting individual purpose to collective flourishing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>C. Technology Integration</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Surrounding cities function as AI- and robot-assisted manufacturing and resource hubs.</li>
      <li>Freed from menial labor, humans focus on learning, creativity, service, and wisdom.</li>
      <li>Self-driving transport links villages and cities, maintaining a networked, sustainable society.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>D. Governance and Culture</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Decisions guided by wisdom councils, communal deliberation, and ethical principles.</li>
      <li>Focus on mentorship, apprenticeship, and moral exemplars to cultivate leadership and virtue.</li>
      <li>Ritual and celebration reinforce alignment with the archetypes: God (awe), Christ (action), Spirit (discernment).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Roadmap for Activation</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Seed Awareness</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Begin where your leadership and vision can be most fruitful.</li>
          <li>Gather early adopters who share curiosity, ethics, and willingness to act.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Model Communities</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Create prototype villages that demonstrate permaculture, education, and communal integration.</li>
          <li>Ensure scalability: network villages into a broader system with resource cities.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Awaken the Body</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspire participation through action, mentorship, and demonstration of wisdom in daily life.</li>
          <li>Spread knowledge tools only as instruments for achieving wisdom and collective growth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Integrate Technology</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use AI, automation, and robotics to free humans for creative and spiritual labor.</li>
          <li>Maintain ethical alignment: technology serves human flourishing, not the reverse.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Expand the Garden</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Scale communities, foster interconnectivity, and create a model society that demonstrates the restoration of Eden.</li>
          <li>Embed archetypal principles in governance, education, and culture: God (beyond self), Christ (embodied ethics), Spirit (discernment).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>5. Ultimate Goal</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebuild Eden on Earth: networked human societies aligned with divine order and wisdom.</li>
      <li>Transcend conflict: expand human consciousness and capacity for collective ethical action.</li>
      <li>Manifest Christ in action: humanity becomes the living body of Christ, reflecting love, wisdom, and justice.</li>
      <li>Sustainably flourish: cultivate communities that are ecologically, socially, and spiritually regenerative.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Humanity has spent millennia preparing for this moment — studying, reflecting, and refining wisdom. The time for passive contemplation is over. It is now the era of faith in action, of building, learning, and embodying the archetype of Christ to restore Eden and cultivate a sustainable, wise, and flourishing civilization.</p>

    <h2>Conceptual Map: Garden of Wisdom Society</h2>
    <h3>1. Central Village (Edenic Core)</h3>
    <h4>Round Central Building</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Symbol: unity, wholeness, equality.</li>
      <li>Functions: governance, community gathering, ceremonial spaces.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Courtyard</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Circular library at the center.</li>
      <li>Purpose: space for dialogue, Socratic learning, mentorship.</li>
      <li>Symbolizes the “Tree of Wisdom.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tree at Central Height</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Represents wisdom, life, and guidance.</li>
      <li>Physical and symbolic: visible from everywhere in the village.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Education Flow</h3>
    <h4>Foundational Education (center of the courtyard/library)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Literacy, numeracy, critical thinking.</li>
      <li>Taught via Socratic-apprentice methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Applied Learning (branches outward)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Children and apprentices choose paths: agriculture, craft, care, technology, research.</li>
      <li>Learning integrated into village life: “child’s place in society.”</li>
      <li>Apprentices contribute directly to community health and productivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Village Layout</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Houses, workshops, gardens arranged in concentric circles around the central hub.</li>
      <li>Shared spaces (kitchens, meeting halls, meditation zones) interwoven with nature.</li>
      <li>Water systems, renewable energy, and permaculture patterns integrated for sustainability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Tech-Integrated Surrounding Cities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AI- and robot-assisted manufacturing hubs: cars, medical supplies, tools, mining, refining.</li>
      <li>Circular transport ring connecting villages to production hubs via self-driving vehicles.</li>
      <li>Cities designed for efficiency, freeing humans for creative, social, and spiritual work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Networks and Expansion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Villages connected in a radial network pattern: each village is a “garden,” connected to others.</li>
      <li>Knowledge/wisdom flows bi-directionally: villages → hubs → other villages.</li>
      <li>Communication, mentorship, and trade integrated with ecological and social consciousness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6. Philosophical/Spiritual Layer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Central tree/library = wisdom over knowledge.</li>
      <li>Village life emphasizes:
        <ul>
          <li>Living as Christ: ethical, compassionate, community-minded.</li>
          <li>Spirit-guided discernment: aligning action with the collective good.</li>
          <li>God-awareness: maintaining humility, curiosity, and awe.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Visual metaphor:
        <ul>
          <li>Concentric circles = community layers.</li>
          <li>Vertical axis = tree = wisdom/connection between human and divine.</li>
          <li>Radial lines = roads, self-driving connections, and networks between villages and production hubs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>7. Optional Visual Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Solar panels, wind turbines, and green roofs for sustainability.</li>
      <li>Gardens, orchards, and permaculture water features integrated into village design.</li>
      <li>Apprenticelike workshops radiating outward, symbolizing learning spreading from the center.</li>
      <li>Central library roof transparent or open, so the tree of wisdom is visible from all directions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Sketch It</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a central circle (main hub).</li>
      <li>Inside it, mark the tree of wisdom and circular library.</li>
      <li>Surround with smaller concentric circles for houses, gardens, workshops.</li>
      <li>Draw radial roads leading outward to other villages and cities.</li>
      <li>Mark surrounding AI/robot-assisted production hubs at the periphery.</li>
      <li>Highlight “flow arrows” showing movement of knowledge, wisdom, and resources.</li>
    </ol>
